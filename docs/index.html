          <h5>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
          </p>

            version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the
            updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we
            make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you
            either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
            directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
            privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
